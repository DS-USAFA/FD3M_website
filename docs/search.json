    "text": "Course Letter\nBelow we highlight sections from the Math 300Z/356Z Spring 2026 course letter. All cadets are responsible for reading the full version of the course letter.\n\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Math 300Z/356Z, Data-Driven Statistics with AI. This course is designed to provide you with statistical, mathematical and computational tools to answer questions from data by providing a solid foundation in probability and a strong introduction to statistical and descriptive modeling. This is the third iteration of this course, which will become the new core statistics and data science course for all cadets at USAFA starting in Fall 2026.\nCourse Identity: You are now, just by being here, a statistician and a data-driven decision maker!\n\n\nLearning Goals\nThe learning goals for this course are to use computational and mathematical statistical/probabilistic concepts, with assistance from generative AI, to:\n\nArticulate the fundamentals of probability models, including discussions about data provenance and the downstream issues that arise due to choices concerning data,\nCreate data visualizations and numerical summaries to communicate about data for a variety of audiences,\nCompare and contrast what typical and unusual means using a variety of definitions for centrality and spread,\nDesign and execute inferential tasks and precisely communicate the results for a variety of audiences, and\nDetail the basics of the machine learning pipeline, specifically how it relates to linear regression.\n\n\n\nUpdated Course\nThis course in data science and statistics is replacing the current four courses in the core fulfilling the statistical reasoning requirement. This course aims to provide a common experience for cadets while meeting The Department of the Air Force’s articulated several priorities for Airmen and Guardians regarding data acumen. As such, this course will meet all graduation requirements for your major and is designed with your future as officers keenly in mind.\n\n\nCourse Materials\nWe will make extensive use of computational methods which depend heavily on software. We will be using free software called R through a web-based platform called Posit Cloud. Grades and some assignments will be available in Gradescope. Course materials and course communications will be in Microsoft Teams. We prefer Teams as the primary method of communication to instructors.\nIn addition to assigned course readings and activities, we will utilize Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and NotebookLM to help us understand concepts, generate and understand code, and interpret models and their output throughout the semester. To do so effectively, we must learn to write and iterate prompts and to validate responses from GenAI tools. These tools will be authorized resources for in-class work and projects, unless otherwise stated. We will not be using GenAI tools for GRs because you need to have a foundation in the course concepts, coding and communicating data analysis.\nCourse Text.  The readings for this course will come from four digitally available textbooks:\n\nDavid Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Christopher D. Barr. OpenIntro Statistics, 4th Edition. Free PDF available at https://openintro.org/book/os/.\nMine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin. Introduction to Modern Statistics, 2nd Edition. Free web-native version available at https://www.openintro-ims.netlify.app (may not work on MissionNet).\nChester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, and Arturo Valdivia. Modern Dive (v2). Free e-book available at https://moderndive.com/v2/.\nBradley Warner, Brianna Hitt, and Ken Horton. Computational Probability and Statistics. Free e-book available at https://ds-usafa.github.io/Quarto-Book/.\nAdditional readings provided by the instructor.\n\n\n\nGraded Events\nThis course uses standards-based grading. Your final grade in this course will be based on how well you achieve 30 standards, which fall into one of three categories: 1) Core Competencies, 2) Application, and 3) Professional Development. The following are brief descriptions of the categories and associated graded events. More specific details will be provided at the time these assessments are administered.\n\nCore Competencies. There are 12 standards that every student leaving this course should have proficiency with. Students will have at least 2 opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of each standard during Graded Reviews (GRs). There are four GRs and a final exam. Each standard is assessed independently using a standards-based grading approach.\nApplication. There are three components in the application category: i) specialty concepts, ii) semester-long group project, and iii) homework assignments. The application category has 10 standards.\nProfessional Development. There are three components in this category: i) professional skills, ii) course participation, and iii) reflection. The professional development category has 8 standards.\n\n\n\nProficiency Levels\nThis course uses a contract grading system designed to reward mastery and professional growth. Your grade will be determined based on performance in 30 total standards across the three key areas. Each standard is evaluated on a four-level proficiency scale, where higher levels reflect deeper integration, judgment and communication – not just correctness.\n\nExceptionally Qualified (EQ) – The student understands the material deeply enough to teach it to others. This represents a different level of mastery – the ability to explain, critique, and guide others.\nQ1 – The student understands the material deeply enough to apply and interpret the concepts independently and correctly, with only minor or infrequent communication errors.\nQ2 – The student understands the material well enough to apply and interpret the concepts independently most of the time, with occasional minor justification errors.\nQ3 – The student demonstrates partial understanding of the material; conceptual gaps, reasoning errors, or major misconceptions are present and must be addressed before the material can be applied reliably.\nCannot Be Assessed – The student has provided incoherent or incomplete evidence of understanding.\n\n\n\nDaily Course Rhythm\nEach lesson of this course will have a pre-class reading assignment with an interactive reading guide. We expect you to be conversant with the assigned readings prior to each class. The assigned readings and the associated reading guides are important learning assets, so use them to prepare for class. This course requires regular and active participation from every student.\nBring your computer to every class. For class time to be beneficial, you must be prepared and participate in each lesson. In class, after a short (10-15 minute) mini-lecture, we will be working with the ideas from the readings in small groups to complete the GPsets. If time permits, we will transition to practice problems in the daily notetaker. After class, in addition to reviewing your own notes from the day, we recommend that you work on the practice problems in the notetakers and come to EI to ask questions. Remember that the homework questions are a selection of the practice problems in the notetakers, and it is strongly recommended that you complete the practice problems as close to their associated lesson as possible.\n\n\nUse of Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models\nUnless otherwise stated, your authorized GenAI resources for all Math 300Z/356Z assignments completed outside of class are Level 4: Use of GenAI to co-create and/or revise work per the Dean’s Guidance for Academically-related GenAI at USAFA. The authorized resources for all Math 300Z/356Z GRs will be Level 0: No use of GenAI because you need to have a foundation in the course concepts, coding and communicating data analysis.\nPlease see the course letter for the full policy of use of AI tools in this course.\n\nDocumentation of GenAI Usage\nWhen utilizing GenAI tools, your documentation statement MUST include the following five parts:\n\nThe name of the GenAI tool (and version, when possible)\nWhat you provided the GenAI tool (a summary of your prompts),\nWhat the GenAI tool provided you (a summary of the output)\nHow you altered the GenAI tool’s output (e.g., how you iterated on prompts or how you edited the response before using it) to be in line with Level 4: Use of GenAI to co-create and/or revise work\nA full transcript (link or pdf file) of your interaction with GenAI tools\n\nExample: I used ChatGPT to help write code for a scatterplot with a regression line. I asked: “How can I plot a scatterplot of height vs weight in R using ggplot2 and add a regression line?” ChatGPT gave me a full ggplot() code snippet.

You will also establish a leader schedule for the entirety of the group project.\nBelow are a few questions that your group should discuss before getting started on this project. This list is by no means exhaustive and some questions may not be relevant to your team.\n\nDo we all know each other’s names and majors?\nWhat about a fun fact about each other?\nHow do we want to be addressed, either in person or online?\nHow will we manage using laptops or other devices with data extraction tools loaded on them?\nWhat are the best ways to contact each other?\nWhat are our expectations for various forms of communication and response times to those communications? Below is a list of different forms of communication that you may want to consider:\n\nPhone calls\nText messages\nSocial Media\nEmails\nTeams\n\nHow will we determine the leader for each task?\nWhat are the obligations of the leader beyond the leader task?\nHow do we expect team members to support the task leader?\nShould we meet as a team in person? Or do we want to do all our work online?\n\nIf we meet in person, how often should we do that? Weekly? By task?\n\nWhat time works best for each of us to get work done?\nDo we prefer to work individually first and then meet as a team, or do we prefer to meet as a team first and then work individually?\nHow will we work together when there are both individual and group tasks?\nHow will we handle conflict if a team member is not pulling their weight or meeting deadlines?\n\n\nLeader Task\nFor this assignment, the leader is tasked with facilitating the team conversation for determining a set of guidelines, expectations, and social norms that all team members are comfortable with and agree to. The leader will submit the list of guidelines, expectations, and social norms that the team has come up with together. They will also submit the team’s leader schedule. This does not mean that the leader is the only one who can write up the list of guidelines or that they must develop the leader schedule. This only means that the leader must be the person to submit the assignment for Group Task #1.\n\nLeader reflection prompt\nWrite a short reflection about what it was like to be the leader for your leader task. Be specific about your leader task and experience. Your reflection should discuss what you did to accomplish your leader task, what was challenging about being the leader, what was easy about being the leader, and what you would do differently the next time that you are a leader of a group or team. Your reflection should be one narrative, instead of a list of “answers” to a set of “questions.”\nYour reflection should be at least 1 page long and no more than 2 pages long, and it should be typed using the Leader_Reflection_TEMPLATE.qmd file. Your reflection must be submitted at the same time as Group Task #1. Both parts should be submitted to Gradescope as separate PDFs.\n\n\n\nSubmitting your assignment\nThe leader will submit the group norms and leader schedule to Gradescope as the Group Task #1 assignment (tagging all project group members). Your submission should be typed using the Stage1_Group_TEMPLATE.qmd file. Your final product must be a PDF, submitted on Gradescope. The leader will then separately upload their leader reflection to the Leader - Group Task #1 assignment in Gradescope."

    "title": "FAQs",
    "section": "Grading System Challenges",
    "text": "Grading System Challenges\n\nThis is by far the most frequently mentioned concern. Students have heard that the grading system is confusing, maybe frustrating, and subjective. Many reported hearing it was difficult to understand how to earn good grades (one even said “everyone left with poor grades”) and felt there was “no way to know what grades or levels of understanding correlated to each medal”. Some students heard that there was a lack of consistency in the grading, with “similar answers” earning a range of grades, and some heard it’s difficult to track your letter grade throughout the course.\n\n\nStandards-based grading\nStandards-based grading is about measuring your learning against clear, pre-defined standards rather than just adding up points. Instead of asking “How many points have I earned?” the question becomes “How well have I mastered the skill or concept?” Your grade reflects what you can consistently do by the end of the course—skills and understanding you’ll actually use later.\n\n\nSubjectivity of grades\nAll grading is subjective. Even in points-based courses, your instructors subjectively decide whether to subtract 2 or 10 points for various mistakes.\nStandards-based grading is typically more objective than traditional grading because everyone is measured against the same clear expectations, you get multiple opportunities to show what you know, and early mistakes don’t hold you back if you improve. It’s also easier for instructors to be consistent because they don’t have to figure out how many points to deduct. Instead, instructors are comparing your work to the proficiency levels defined in the course letter.\n\n\nWhy It’s Beneficial to You\nStandards-based grading places the focus on learning, not chasing points. Mistakes early on don’t doom you — you can show growth and still earn the highest marks. In the real world, no one cares if you once got 72% on a project — they care whether you can actually do the task now. Think about learning to drive — You don’t “average” your early driving mistakes with later successes to decide if you get your license. You keep practicing until you meet the standard for safe driving. That’s what standards-based grading does — it certifies that you’ve actually mastered the skills, not just accumulated enough points.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Proficiency Levels\nThis course previously used Gold, Silver, and Bronze to describe levels of achievement toward a given standard. We’ve renamed these proficiency levels to mirror one example of standards-based grading you’ll see in your careers as AF/SF officers. Federal employees are scored using standards-based grading on annual appraisals/performance plans, and pilots are scored using standards-based grading when qualifying on an aircraft.\nWhen pilots want to qualify on an aircraft, they have to pass checkrides. Those checkrides are scored as Q1, Q2, or Q3. This semester, each standard in the course will be scored on a similar scale: Exceptionally Qualified, Q1, Q2, or Q3.\nBased on Spring and Fall 2025 cadet feedback, we have redefined these proficiency levels too. Previously, your answer had to be perfect to earn a Q1. This semester, we recognize an instructor-level answer as Exceptionally Qualified and it is completely optional to attain that proficiency level. Your grade will be based on the amount of Q1, Q2, and Q3 standards you earn throughout the semester.\nBased on previous cadet feedback, we include opportunities throughout the semester for you to see what a Q1, Q2, and Q3 response look like, prior to the GRs. We also encourage you to seek EI if you’re not sure what a Q1, Q2, or Q3 answer might look like for a certain type of question.\n\n\nTracking Your Grades\nWe are adapting our grade tracker for the revised proficiency levels and will provide this as a resource to you, so that you can track your proficiency throughout the semester. Additionally, every cadet will receive a list of the core competency standards descriptions and their current proficiency levels for each GR, to help you in deciding which problems should be completed.\n\n\nGrades going into the Final Exam\nSome cadets are entering the course with the belief that it is impossible to have a good grade before the final, that everyone walks into the final with an F. This is not quite the case, so let’s break this down a bit.\nIn a points-based course, the final exam must be worth at least 25% of the course grade. Let’s say you’re in a points-based course worth a total of 1000 points and the final is worth 250 of those points. Then everyone is walking into the final with a C (assuming you have all 750 points available so far) or lower.\nWhat’s different about this course is that you will have seen and been tested on all 12 core competency standards prior to the final exam, and you’ll have another chance to attempt any of those 12 on the final exam. You can complete as much or as little of the final exam as you choose. Your final grade in this course is primarily based on your achievement of the 12 core competency standards. The professional development standards are largely completion based, and the application standards relate to homework, specialties, and the group project. These other categories can either “plus up” or “downgrade” your course grade, based on the amount of time and effort you put into the course assignments.\nYou will also have the grade tracker spreadsheet to track your proficiency levels throughout the semester, and you’re always able to chat with your instructor about where you stand in the course. We are also hopeful that the revised proficiency level descriptions will help you to better understand your grade in the course as we go.\n\n\nFinal Grades in the Course\nSome cadets heard the grading system was so harsh that “a lot of people ended up on academic probation at prog” or that “everyone left with poor grades” last semester. Neither of these statements is true.\nIn Spring 2025, 52% of the course (40/77 cadets) earned an A or B. In Fall 2025, 57% of the course (89/155 cadets) earned an A or B.\nThe grade distribution for the last two semesters of Math Z are shown below.\n\nNo one ended up on academic probation at prog solely due to Math Z last semester. The three Fs in Fall 2025 represent students who did not complete numerous assignments and/or did not take advantage of the opportunity to reattempt core competency standards throughout the semester.\n\n\nGrading Consistency\nWe did get feedback that some students compared answers on GR questions last semester and felt like the same answer resulted in different scores for different cadets. The main reason for this is differences in communication on GRs - communication is very important in statistics and there was a wide range of it on GRs. Apparent discrepancies in grades were almost always the result of correct/incorrect terminology or more/less effective communication in cadet answers."

Additionally, one student wrote “I have heard that this classes medal system (or Q system), while less punishing, is way more time consuming than points based.”\n\n\nDaily Battle Rhythm of the course\nWe are asking you to complete daily work (GPsets and reading guides) because it’s important for you to practice the skills in this course on a daily basis. Remember that all the daily work is graded on completion. We don’t expect you to understand all concepts or examples before class. We just expect that you complete the reading assignment, interact with the NotebookLM reading guide in some way, and bring questions to class.\nThis course is a 3-credit hour course. The expectation for all 3-credit hour courses is for every one hour class session, you should spend 2 hours outside of class working on that course. If you have Math Z on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday in a given week, that means you should expect to spend ~6 hours outside class on the course that week.\n\n\nNon-math penalties / grading for terminology\nWe did get feedback that some students compared answers on GR questions last semester and felt like the same answer resulted in different scores for different cadets. Apparent discrepancies in grades were almost always the result of correct/incorrect terminology or more/less effective communication in cadet answers. Some cadets even said it “seems to be like a pass-or-fail class, and if you don’t know certain terms verbatim, then you fail” or they heard “there were point deductions for non-math-related errors without much feedback”.\nThis is not a pass/fail class and we don’t expect you to know all the concepts verbatim. That being said, communication is very important in statistics. Much of the GRs are focused on concepts and communication rather than calculations or code. To achieve a certain core competency standard, you need to be able to correctly implement and communicate about a particular topic. Also, there are three things we expect you to know “word-for-word” in this class by the end of the semester, but we’ll footstomp those A LOT so you know what to expect.\n\n\nComparisons to current versions of Math 300/356/377\nThe current versions of Math 300, Math 356, and Math 377 cover the same four blocks of content that we’ll cover this semester. All three courses use R/RStudio in the Posit Cloud environment, and all three courses emphasize simulation-based inference over more traditional methods like using t- and Z-tables.\nThis is not a ‘harder’ version of Math 300 nor is it an ‘easier’ version of Math 356, but we recognize that some of you have heard “it’s much more difficult to earn a good grade in comparison to ‘regular’ stats”. The main differences in Math 300, Math 356, and Math 377 were in the depth of content. This course combines those three populations (and cadets who would have previously taken BehSci 332) and makes adjustments as appropriate.\nThe final GPA for the DFMS statistics courses for the last two semesters are shown below:\n\n \n\n\nCourse\nFinal GPA in Spring 2025\nFinal GPA in Fall 2025\n\n\n\n\nMath Z\n2.89\n2.81\n\n\nMath 300 (regular)\n2.67\n2.95\n\n\nMath 356 (regular)\n3.04\n3.04\n\n\nMath 377 (regular, Fall 2024 for comparison)\n\n2.96"

    "text": "Experimental Nature and Uncertainty around the course\n\nThe course’s experimental nature itself is a source of concern, as it’s “intimidating to take an experimental course because the class might still change and develop which can make it stressful”. Students are “concerned for the experimental portion” and nervous about being guinea pigs for a “new way of teaching and grading”. A student expressed curiosity as to “why the 300, 356 and 377 were so similar in the first place that they could be combined”.\n\nThis course is no longer experimental! There has been a push for the USAFA core curriculum to provide a common experience for cadets, no matter their major, and the Air Force and Space Force have clearly expressed a need for greater data acumen among all officers in recent years. This course has been approved by all DF departments and is soon-to-be-approved by the Academy Board as the single core statistics/data science course for cadets from all majors starting in Fall 2026.\nThat being said, “experimental” or “Z” courses can definitely seem intimidating at first, but we’ve put a lot of thought into this course. The course will not be changing while you take it this semester, but we do welcome your feedback as we continue to develop this course for future semesters.\n\nIs this a new way of teaching/grading?\nThis is not a new way of teaching or grading. The field of statistics education has been moving toward simulation-based statistics and emphasizing the use of technology and data in introductory statistics courses for the last 15 years.\nStandards-based grading is not used widely at USAFA, but it has been mainstream in higher education for more than 10 years and there is extensive research about its benefits for students."

    "section": "Course Organization and Structure",
    "text": "Course Organization and Structure\n\nStudents reported the course being “unorganized and ran confusingly”. There’s concern about managing “so many platforms (Posit Cloud, R, NotebookLM, GenAI, Teams, Blackboard, GradeScope)”. Questions were raised about how to “study for a GR / Final and finding resources to study from”.\n\n\nOrganization of the course\nTo be honest, this course was unorganized and somewhat confusing for the first iteration in Spring 2025. A lot of this came from the effects of the stress and churn of the spring semester on civilian faculty and it being the first time the course ran. We have done a lot of work since last spring semester to simplify and organize components of this course and improve our communication wherever possible.\n\n\nPlatforms used in the course\nWe will do our very best to help you manage the different platforms in the course. Our daily work is going to be in Posit Cloud. That is where you will use R/RStudio, so that is a single platform. All graded work will be submitted in Gradescope. There are many GenAI tools out there, but we’re going to emphasize NotebookLM this semester. You are welcome to use other tools as you are comfortable. Course communication will be in Teams. We will only use Blackboard for submitting prog and final grades, so you do not need to interact with Blackboard in this course.\n\n\nStudying for GRs\nWe’re confident that past GR questions are available to you in the Cadet Wing, so those problems are a good resource to study for GRs. The daily practice problems will turn into graded homework problems, and those are a great way to study for GRs as well. Additionally, we encourage the use of GenAI tools to create your own practice problems/examples when studying for GRs. You should provide an example problem wherever possible, but GenAI tools can personalize practice problems based on the lesson or course learning objectives, based on the core competency standards descriptions, or based on your own interests.\nWe recommend the following when prompting GenAI for practice problems. A strong prompt includes the following four elements:\n\nRole: Who should the GenAI tool act as? (e.g., a statistics instructor, a STEM tutor, a commander)\nTask: What do you want the GenAI tool to do? Clear, specific instructions for what you want it to do\nOutput: What should the response look like? Format, structure, tone, number of problems, with or without solutions. This is a great place to provide an example from our GPset or from the reading (e.g., please provide practice problems similar to this one from my notetaker).\nContext: What background does the GenAI tool need? Provide background materials (assignment instructions, rubric, this student is a Biology major, etc.)\nPro Tip: Before submitting your full prompt, ask the AI: “What else do you need to know to complete this task effectively?” Then revise your prompt accordingly."

    "section": "Technology and Tools (Coding/AI)",
    "text": "Technology and Tools (Coding/AI)\n\nA common theme is the integration of coding and artificial intelligence. Students are concerned about “working with some artificial intelligence that may be unfamiliar” and that there is “a lot of coding involved”. Many expressed discomfort with or a “difficult” learning curve for RStudio, as they “have not used it before this class” or needed to remember how to use it.\n\nThis is not a coding class. You will be expected to use code on homeworks and the project, but we encourage you to use your resources (code provided in class, Google, Stack Overflow, GenAI tools like ChatGPT, etc.). We will always provide scaffolded code the first time we introduce you to a coding skill in R. We will never ask you to generate code from scratch in a timed environment (GRs) and we do not expect you to memorize code for this course.\n\nComputing tools\nWe are utilizing computing tools like Posit Cloud (R/RStudio) as a resource. Modern statistics cannot be separated from technology, and trust us - you don’t want to run these models or create visualizations by hand. While we acknowledge there can be a learning curve with RStudio/Posit Cloud, we will provide you with what you need when you need it (in regards to using Posit Cloud). We also put out some supplemental resources for those interested - see the RStudio folder under the Files tab in our course team.\n\n\nGenAI tools\nBeing able to use GenAI tools such as NotebookLM, ChatGPT, and other platforms is an essential skill for future AF/SF officers and anyone entering the job market today. In fact, Secretary Hegseth put out a release about GenAI.mil, saying, “I expect every member of the Department to log in, learn it, and incorporate it into your workflows immediately. AI should be in your battle rhythm every single day. It should be your teammate. By mastering this tool, we will outpace our adversaries. The power is now in your hands.”\nWe will not be grading you on any work that depends on GenAI tools. For the reading guides, we’re requiring you to interact with NotebookLM in some way, and we provide prompts to get you started. This is our way of trying to train you in responsible use of the tool and we’ll continue to provide examples and prompts throughout the semester.\n\n\nDocumentation Statements\nSome students have said “I am concerned with documentation because it is really lengthy and I fear I could make a mistake and miss something.” Please be assured that we approach GenAI usage and documentation as skills that you need to develop. We aim to help you grow in the responsible and proficient use of GenAI tools this semester.\nAlso, remember that if your instructor suspects you utilized GenAI tools without co-creating or with insufficient documentation, they will meet with you first to discuss and find ways to improve your usage and/or documentation. You may be asked to redo any graded work as deemed appropriate by your instructor and/or the course director. If there are recurrent issues related to GenAI usage or documentation, it may result in initiation of the honor process and/or an academic penalty."

    "section": "Concern from Math 377 students",
    "text": "Concern from Math 377 students\n\nSome of the 377 students have heard that Math 377 is called “Hell Stats” and they are nervous for the course. A significant concern among students in the experimental class is whether they “won’t be as prepared for 378 next semester” in terms of “the level of difficulty of using the content,” even if “the content is pretty much the same”. Math 377 students are “hoping to still get the same information as we would have if we had taken the regular course while also learning about it in a more manageable format” in the experimental class.\n\nAll Math 377 students (Math/Applied Math, Data Science, and Operations Research majors) were enrolled in the Math 300Z/356Z/377Z course in Fall 2025 due to staffing in DFMS this year. The Math Z course will fulfill the core requirement for statistical reasoning that was previously filled by Math 300/356/377 or BehSci 332.\nMath Z will also count as the prerequisite for Math 378 Applied Statistical Modeling, for any students required to take or interested in taking that course. We can assure you that this course will prepare you for Math 378 - Dr. Hitt has been the course director of Math 377/378 for the past four years, so you’re in good hands!\nThe primary difference between Math 377 and this experimental course is that we’ve removed some of the advanced probability topics. These topics are not necessary for Math 378 and many statisticians don’t see those topics until graduate school. Some of these advanced probability topics will be available to you as one of four specialties that you will choose as part of the Application standards. All DF departments are aware of this change, and we are working with some of them to prepare major-specific specialties in the Math Z course."
