    "text": "In a group of 3-4 statisticians, you will be creating a report about a data set for a Permanent Party Squadron Commander (PPSC). Your final report will state a data-driven conclusion about the data set your group presents. You will work on three individual and four group assignments throughout the semester.\nYou will be assigned into groups based on the inputs in your Group Project Form, submitted by Lesson 04.\n\n\n\n\nApply statistical concepts and data science ideas to a data set, with the purpose of making a conclusion.\nCreate a report that is understandable by a non-statistical audience that makes use of figures, tables, and sections as appropriate.\nWork collaboratively in a group setting, leveraging each group member’s strengths.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several project checkpoints throughout the semester. These checkpoints are designed to help you complete the project successfully without a huge, last-minute effort at the end of the term. There are both group and individual checkpoints, outlined below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Type and Topic\nDue Date\nLeader Task?\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Task #1 - Finding Data\nT6\nNo\n\n\nGroup Task #1 - Establishing Group Norms\nT11\nYes\n\n\nIndividual Task #2 - Data Wrangling and Data Viz\nT15\nYes\n\n\nGroup Task #2 - Choosing a Research Question, Dataset, and Mentor\nT21\nYes\n\n\nProject Feedback Day (In-class)\nM27/T27\nNo\n\n\nIndividual Task #3 - Revising the Exploration\nT29\nYes\n\n\nGroup Task #3 - Proposing a Data Task\nT34\nYes\n\n\nGroup Task #4 - Final Submission\nT39\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\nFive of the seven assignments have “Leader tasks” associated with them. Each leader task includes a brief reflection.\nYour group must complete all five leader tasks. Each statistician in your group must be the leader at least once and no one can be the leader more than twice. It is strongly recommended that your group creates a leader schedule early in the semester to ensure that you meet these conditions and so that everyone knows who will be leading when.\n\n\n\nAs part of Group Task #2, groups will select at least one mentor with a military background from whom they will solicit feedback on the mid-term project submission (Group Task #2). The mentor will be asked to provide feedback on the professionalism, formatting, and communication of the mid-term submission using a provided rubric. The mentor should be a non-statistician and can be one of the group member’s PPSCs or AMTs, a faculty member, an OIC or OR, or even a sponsor.\n\n\n\nThere are four medals associated with this project:\n\nDraft submission medal, based on the group data proposal (Group Task #2)\nFinal submission medal, based on final report (Group Task #4)\nFinal submission medal, based on final report and individual task completion\nFeedback medal, based on the quality of feedback you offer your group members at the end of the semester\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to use many templates as future officers in the Air Force or Space Force, so we are explicitly including correct use of templates as part of the tasks throughout the project. Correctly using the template is part of each assignment and will contribute to one of the final project medals."

    "text": "Course Letter\nBelow we highlight sections from the Math 300Z/356Z Spring 2026 course letter. All cadets are responsible for reading the full version of the course letter.\n\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Math 300Z/356Z, Data-Driven Statistics with AI. This course is designed to provide you with statistical, mathematical and computational tools to answer questions from data by providing a solid foundation in probability and a strong introduction to statistical and descriptive modeling. This is the third iteration of this course, which will become the new core statistics and data science course for all cadets at USAFA starting in Fall 2026.\nCourse Identity: You are now, just by being here, a statistician and a data-driven decision maker!\n\n\nLearning Goals\nThe learning goals for this course are to use computational and mathematical statistical/probabilistic concepts, with assistance from generative AI, to:\n\nArticulate the fundamentals of probability models, including discussions about data provenance and the downstream issues that arise due to choices concerning data,\nCreate data visualizations and numerical summaries to communicate about data for a variety of audiences,\nCompare and contrast what typical and unusual means using a variety of definitions for centrality and spread,\nDesign and execute inferential tasks and precisely communicate the results for a variety of audiences, and\nDetail the basics of the machine learning pipeline, specifically how it relates to linear regression.\n\n\n\nUpdated Course\nThis course in data science and statistics is replacing the current four courses in the core fulfilling the statistical reasoning requirement. This course aims to provide a common experience for cadets while meeting The Department of the Air Force’s articulated several priorities for Airmen and Guardians regarding data acumen. As such, this course will meet all graduation requirements for your major and is designed with your future as officers keenly in mind.\n\n\nCourse Materials\nWe will make extensive use of computational methods which depend heavily on software. We will be using free software called R through a web-based platform called Posit Cloud. Grades and some assignments will be available in Gradescope. Course materials and course communications will be in Microsoft Teams. We prefer Teams as the primary method of communication to instructors.\nIn addition to assigned course readings and activities, we will utilize Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and NotebookLM to help us understand concepts, generate and understand code, and interpret models and their output throughout the semester. To do so effectively, we must learn to write and iterate prompts and to validate responses from GenAI tools. These tools will be authorized resources for in-class work and projects, unless otherwise stated. We will not be using GenAI tools for GRs because you need to have a foundation in the course concepts, coding and communicating data analysis.\nCourse Text.  The readings for this course will come from four digitally available textbooks:\n\nDavid Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Christopher D. Barr. OpenIntro Statistics, 4th Edition. Free PDF available at https://openintro.org/book/os/.\nMine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin. Introduction to Modern Statistics, 2nd Edition. Free web-native version available at https://www.openintro-ims.netlify.app (may not work on MissionNet).\nChester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, and Arturo Valdivia. Modern Dive (v2). Free e-book available at https://moderndive.com/v2/.\nBradley Warner, Brianna Hitt, and Ken Horton. Computational Probability and Statistics. Free e-book available at https://ds-usafa.github.io/Quarto-Book/.\nAdditional readings provided by the instructor.\n\n\n\nGraded Events\nThis course uses standards-based grading. Your final grade in this course will be based on how well you achieve 30 standards, which fall into one of three categories: 1) Core Competencies, 2) Application, and 3) Professional Development. The following are brief descriptions of the categories and associated graded events. More specific details will be provided at the time these assessments are administered.\n\nCore Competencies. There are 12 standards that every student leaving this course should have proficiency with. Students will have at least 2 opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of each standard during Graded Reviews (GRs). There are four GRs and a final exam. Each standard is assessed independently using a standards-based grading approach.\nApplication. There are three components in the application category: i) specialty concepts, ii) semester-long group project, and iii) homework assignments. The application category has 10 standards.\nProfessional Development. There are three components in this category: i) professional skills, ii) course participation, and iii) reflection. The professional development category has 8 standards.\n\n\n\nProficiency Levels\nThis course uses a contract grading system designed to reward mastery and professional growth. Your grade will be determined based on performance in 30 total standards across the three key areas. Each standard is evaluated on a four-level proficiency scale, where higher levels reflect deeper integration, judgment and communication – not just correctness.\n\nExceptionally Qualified (EQ) – The student understands the material deeply enough to teach it to others. This represents a different level of mastery – the ability to explain, critique, and guide others.\nQ1 – The student understands the material deeply enough to apply and interpret the concepts independently and correctly, with only minor or infrequent communication errors.\nQ2 – The student understands the material well enough to apply and interpret the concepts independently most of the time, with occasional minor justification errors.\nQ3 – The student demonstrates partial understanding of the material; conceptual gaps, reasoning errors, or major misconceptions are present and must be addressed before the material can be applied reliably.\nCannot Be Assessed – The student has provided incoherent or incomplete evidence of understanding.\n\n\n\nDaily Course Rhythm\nEach lesson of this course will have a pre-class reading assignment with an interactive reading guide. We expect you to be conversant with the assigned readings prior to each class. The assigned readings and the associated reading guides are important learning assets, so use them to prepare for class. This course requires regular and active participation from every student.\nBring your computer to every class. For class time to be beneficial, you must be prepared and participate in each lesson. In class, after a short (10-15 minute) mini-lecture, we will be working with the ideas from the readings in small groups to complete the GPsets. If time permits, we will transition to practice problems in the daily notetaker. After class, in addition to reviewing your own notes from the day, we recommend that you work on the practice problems in the notetakers and come to EI to ask questions. Remember that the homework questions are a selection of the practice problems in the notetakers, and it is strongly recommended that you complete the practice problems as close to their associated lesson as possible.\n\n\nUse of Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models\nUnless otherwise stated, your authorized GenAI resources for all Math 300Z/356Z assignments completed outside of class are Level 4: Use of GenAI to co-create and/or revise work per the Dean’s Guidance for Academically-related GenAI at USAFA. The authorized resources for all Math 300Z/356Z GRs will be Level 0: No use of GenAI because you need to have a foundation in the course concepts, coding and communicating data analysis.\nPlease see the course letter for the full policy of use of AI tools in this course.\n\nDocumentation of GenAI Usage\nWhen utilizing GenAI tools, your documentation statement MUST include the following five parts:\n\nThe name of the GenAI tool (and version, when possible)\nWhat you provided the GenAI tool (a summary of your prompts),\nWhat the GenAI tool provided you (a summary of the output)\nHow you altered the GenAI tool’s output (e.g., how you iterated on prompts or how you edited the response before using it) to be in line with Level 4: Use of GenAI to co-create and/or revise work\nA full transcript (link or pdf file) of your interaction with GenAI tools\n\nExample: I used ChatGPT to help write code for a scatterplot with a regression line. I asked: “How can I plot a scatterplot of height vs weight in R using ggplot2 and add a regression line?” ChatGPT gave me a full ggplot() code snippet. I edited the code to use my dataset name (cadet_data) and customized axis labels and colors. https://chatgpt.com/share/6942d3ea-f350-8013-b0a5-55aac51ba119\n\n\n\nFinal Comments\nWe are confident in your ability to succeed in this course, but we expect you to have a positive attitude, put in the work and take responsibility for your own learning. Stay engaged, make suggestions for improvement, ask questions, and maintain professionalism. It is up to you what you get from the course. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask for help. We’re looking forward to learning and working with you this semester!"

It is strongly recommended that your group creates a leader schedule early in the semester to ensure that you meet these conditions and so that everyone knows who will be leading when.\n\n\n\nAs part of Group Task #2, groups will select at least one mentor with a military background from whom they will solicit feedback on the mid-term project submission (Group Task #2). The mentor will be asked to provide feedback on the professionalism, formatting, and communication of the mid-term submission using a provided rubric. The mentor should be a non-statistician and can be one of the group member’s PPSCs or AMTs, a faculty member, an OIC or OR, or even a sponsor.\n\n\n\nThere are four medals associated with this project:\n\nDraft submission medal, based on the group data proposal (Group Task #2)\nFinal submission medal, based on final report (Group Task #4)\nFinal submission medal, based on final report and individual task completion\nFeedback medal, based on the quality of feedback you offer your group members at the end of the semester\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to use many templates as future officers in the Air Force or Space Force, so we are explicitly including correct use of templates as part of the tasks throughout the project. Correctly using the template is part of each assignment and will contribute to one of the final project medals."

    "text": "Group Task #1 - Establishing Group Norms - Due 2359 on T11\nYour team is still fairly new and before you get too far into this project, it is a good idea to establish a set of guidelines, expectations, and social norms. You will also establish a leader schedule for the entirety of the group project.\nBelow are a few questions that your group should discuss before getting started on this project. This list is by no means exhaustive and some questions may not be relevant to your team.\n\nDo we all know each other’s names and majors?\nWhat about a fun fact about each other?\nHow do we want to be addressed, either in person or online?\nHow will we manage using laptops or other devices with data extraction tools loaded on them?\nWhat are the best ways to contact each other?\nWhat are our expectations for various forms of communication and response times to those communications? Below is a list of different forms of communication that you may want to consider:\n\nPhone calls\nText messages\nSocial Media\nEmails\nTeams\n\nHow will we determine the leader for each task?\nWhat are the obligations of the leader beyond the leader task?\nHow do we expect team members to support the task leader?\nShould we meet as a team in person? Or do we want to do all our work online?\n\nIf we meet in person, how often should we do that? Weekly? By task?\n\nWhat time works best for each of us to get work done?\nDo we prefer to work individually first and then meet as a team, or do we prefer to meet as a team first and then work individually?\nHow will we work together when there are both individual and group tasks?\nHow will we handle conflict if a team member is not pulling their weight or meeting deadlines?\n\n\nLeader Task\nFor this assignment, the leader is tasked with facilitating the team conversation for determining a set of guidelines, expectations, and social norms that all team members are comfortable with and agree to. The leader will submit the list of guidelines, expectations, and social norms that the team has come up with together. They will also submit the team’s leader schedule. This does not mean that the leader is the only one who can write up the list of guidelines or that they must develop the leader schedule. This only means that the leader must be the person to submit the assignment for Group Task #1.\n\nLeader reflection prompt\nWrite a short reflection about what it was like to be the leader for your leader task. Be specific about your leader task and experience. Your reflection should discuss what you did to accomplish your leader task, what was challenging about being the leader, what was easy about being the leader, and what you would do differently the next time that you are a leader of a group or team. Your reflection should be one narrative, instead of a list of “answers” to a set of “questions.”\nYour reflection should be at least 1 page long and no more than 2 pages long, and it should be typed using the Leader_Reflection_TEMPLATE.qmd file. Your reflection must be submitted at the same time as Group Task #1. Both parts should be submitted to Gradescope as separate PDFs.\n\n\n\nSubmitting your assignment\nThe leader will submit the group norms and leader schedule to Gradescope as the Group Task #1 assignment (tagging all project group members). Your submission should be typed using the Stage1_Group_TEMPLATE.qmd file. Your final product must be a PDF, submitted on Gradescope. The leader will then separately upload their leader reflection to the Leader - Group Task #1 assignment in Gradescope."
